# odin-recipes

This is a project from the Odin Project where I built a simple recipe website.  

Although I already know quite a bit of HTML and CSS, I wanted to take another course and work on some simpler projects like this in order to stay current on best practices.

Honestly, I got a lot of great practice using git to create pages and directories for this project.  Normally I do that sort of thing using the UI, so it was interesting trying a new method.
